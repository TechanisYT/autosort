# autosort
A simple bash script to autosort any Folder

You can make an alias to use in any folder in your .bashrc or .zshrc

```
alias autosort="~/Programs/Scripts/autosort/autosort.sh"
```

# Config

At the top of the script is the config where you can change the file extensions and the folders they get sorted into.
There are also protected directories which the script prevents you from using because you may shuffle around files that should not be moved.

# WARNING

I do not guarantee that this script works 100%.
Using it is at your own risk. 
Maybe it could delete files as I am not experienced in bash scripting and this is written mostly by AI.
Therefore I take no responsibility for damadge it may cause.
